# First step - Why Ruby?

When I decided to build my personal website I could have used React or just plain html and CSS with Netlify deploy.
ðŸ˜’ But no, somebody had the bright idea to build with Ruby on Rails and Jekyll.

This site was suppose to be simple in functionality
* Generate pages of post
* Support images
* Include content about, yours truly, Richard
* Have a smooth blogging experience

At that time I was interested in learning Ruby so I thought why not use that. That was when the trouble began.
