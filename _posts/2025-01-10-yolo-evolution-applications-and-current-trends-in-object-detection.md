YOLO (You Only Look Once) has transformed from a groundbreaking concept to an industry standard in object detection since its inception in 2015[1]. Initially developed by Joseph Redmon and Ali Farhadi at the University of Washington, YOLO gained popularity for its unprecedented speed and accuracy[1].

The evolution timeline showcases significant improvements:

- YOLOv2 (2016): Introduced batch normalization and anchor boxes

- YOLOv3 (2018): Enhanced backbone network and spatial pyramid pooling

- YOLOv4 (2020): Added Mosaic data augmentation and new loss functions

- YOLOv5: Brought hyperparameter optimization and experiment tracking

- YOLOv6-8: Expanded capabilities across multiple vision AI tasks

- YOLOv9: Implemented Programmable Gradient Information

- YOLOv10: Introduced End-to-End head eliminating NMS requirements

- YOLO11: Latest version offering state-of-the-art performance[1]
