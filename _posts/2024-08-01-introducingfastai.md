In case you ever have to do Deep learning or interested in building applications with neural networks you can check out [fastai](https://course.fast.ai/) by Jeremy Howard.

## Practical Deep Learning
"A free course designed for people with some coding experience, who want to learn how to apply deep learning and machine learning to practical problems."

This is the book that forms the basis for the course. It is recommended readingas you complete the course. There’s a few ways to read the book – you can buy it as a paper book or Kindle ebook, or you can read it for free [online](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook). The whole book is written as Jupyter notebooks, so you can also execute all the code in the book yourself.

Here is  a breakdown of the chapters:
* Chapter 1, Intro
* Chapter 2, Production
* Chapter 3, Ethics
* Chapter 4, MNIST Basics
* Chapter 5, Pet Breeds
* Chapter 6, Multi-Category
* Chapter 7, Sizing and TTA
* Chapter 8, Collab
* Chapter 9, Tabular
* Chapter 10, NLP
* Chapter 11, Mid-Level API
* Chapter 12, NLP Deep-Dive
* Chapter 13, Convolutions
* Chapter 14, Resnet
* Chapter 15, Arch Details
* Chapter 16, Optimizers and Callbacks
* Chapter 17, Foundations
* Chapter 18, GradCAM
* Chapter 19, Learner
* Chapter 20, Conclusion

### The usual way of building deep learning models
The traditional way of building deep learning models using a framework such as pytorch or tensorflow could take a lot of time to build and train models. In my experience the student might have to go through a lot of theory before they even build their first useful model.

Fastai does the opposite where they show you how to build models and solve problems to give an understanding of what's possible then dive into the theory and its underpinings.
